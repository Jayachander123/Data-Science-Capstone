On the other side investing in Housing has also become a lucky draw sometimes, good investments turn out to be bad investments sometime decisions like Amazon second headquarters announcement in near New York Area but later change in the decision results in plunge down quickly in real estate. \n\n### 1.3\tCurious \nBeing curious on this case study Preparing data from various real estate companies and by applying machine learning tools and techniques predicting the housing prices may be helps the problems I have described above to some extent.
